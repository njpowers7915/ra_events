# RaEvents

UPDATE UPDATE

This Ruby CLI app lets you search for electronic music events in your state. The app allows you to select individual events to look up important details as listed on the website, "www.residentadvisor.net".


## Installation and Usage

Clone this repo in order to access the app. Once you've navigated into the ra_events directory run:

    $ ./bin/ra_events

...then follow the prompts to find events near you!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
